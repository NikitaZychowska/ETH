Map minerals occurrences from OpenMindat using Python and packets and geologicalmaps of rivers. Let's find key elements of rivers!

This project demonstrates how many key elements from rocks you can find in river by:
1. Code using Python
1. Fetching key elements on OpenMindat API (https://quexiang.github.io/OpenMindat/)
3. Add any data - raster maps
